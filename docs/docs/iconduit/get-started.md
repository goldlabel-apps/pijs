1. Clone or fork repo into your working directory
2. Branch off it with your own branch name
3. Install dependencies & run

```bash
cd <working-dir>/iconduit
yarn && yarn start
```

4. Locate the template folder called `./projects/new-project`
   and copy it into the `./projects` directory, renaming it to
   a new project's name.

   In this example, our project is called **Be More Steve**. There are
   a few different possible naming conventions, but here we use;
   `./projects/be-more-steve` because the name might end up in a url.

```bash
be-more-steve (url-safe)
BeMoreSteve
beMoreSteve (camelCase)
```
