## Background

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML based image format for two-dimensional vector graphics.

The SVG specification is an open standard which has been around since 1999.

SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. This means that they can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. As XML files, SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, as well as with drawing software.

All major modern web browsers—including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and even Microsoft Edge—have SVG rendering support.
