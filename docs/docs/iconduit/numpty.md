## What is a numpty in this context?

A numpty is what we derogatively refer to our basline user as. It's not a lovely word to be called. No one wants to be a numpty, so we try not to call our customers numpties. Even they they are. Our job is to build software which is numpty-proof.

### Etymology

**Numpty** 1980s: of Scottish origin, perhaps an alteration of numbskull, with the ending remodelled on the pattern of Humpty Dumpty.
