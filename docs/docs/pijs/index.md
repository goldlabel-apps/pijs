After 20 years in the software industry we've started to get involved with hardware. Specifically the Raspberry Pi.

### What is a Raspberry Pi?

The Raspberry Pi is a very low cost, credit-card sized computer. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Python. It can also give more experienced developers a chance to do some mad cool stuff they wouldn't normally do. We're going to turn our Pi into a Node server, connected to the interweb through an everyday broadband connection.

The current iteration (which we are using) is the Pi4, or to giv it it's full title, [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4 GB)](https://www.littlebird.com.au/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4-gb).
