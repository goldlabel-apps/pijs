### What is a Pi?

The Raspberry Pi is a very low cost, credit-card sized computer. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Python.

It also give more experienced developers a chance to do some mad cool stuff like turning a Pi into a node server accessible over SSL through normal home broadband.
